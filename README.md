# Finapp
*A template of a personal financial dashboard mobile app*

My main goal was to learn dart and flutter in a practical way.

## Main Functionality of the app

* Storage (adding, removing, editing) of transactions;
* Each transaction has the following features:
  * Title
  * Amount and currency
  * Type (income or expense)
  * Description
  * Date and Time
  * Category
* Search within transactions for all of the features of a transaction;
* Visualisation:
  * Bar Chart
  * Pie Chart
* Settings:
  * Switch of currency conversion (up-to-date currency rate fetched up from the web)
  * Categories management
